                <h3>The Excellent Exam Revision Plan</h3>
            </strong>
            <p>
            Revision must be one of the most individualized processes within academic life. While it is
            possible to get ideas from others and from books, about how to revise, you also need to get to
            know what your own personal strengths and weaknesses are. How much do you already know?
            How do you revise? What are the factors that usually cause problems for you in managing your
            revision?
            </p>
            <p>
            We all understand the importance of revision. Most work hard at it, but we don't always work
            well at it. As with any other aspect of your studies, you need to organize your time and plan your
            revision in advance.
            </p>
            <p>
            The main purpose for revising is always to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Understand the topic for which you are sitting an exam
                </li>
                <li>
                    Commit what you have learnt and understood to memory
                </li>
                <li>
                    Practice planning and writing answers to questions
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            To enable you to do this, you will need to organize your class notes, books and other revision
            materials in a nice way. This section includes a series of examination papers and assessment tests
            that will help improve your grade as your progress towards your final exam. It also includes
            advice and other useful nuggets that will guide you as you organize your revision and study plan:
